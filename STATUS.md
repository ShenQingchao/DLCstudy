**Apply for the badges:**  Artifacts Evaluated & Artifacts Available

**The reasons why we believe that the artifact deserves the "Artifact Available" and "Artifact Evaluated" badges:**

Our artifact contains all relevant files and codes and is publicly available. It can easily be replicated. Therefore, we apply for the badges "Artifact Available" and "Artifact Evaluated".

A public GitHub repository is used to store the artifacts, which contain all required materials. In addition, we useÂ Zenodo to archiving our GitHub repository releases. The DOI of our artifact is [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/342103158.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/342103158). Therefore, we believe that the artifact deserves the "Artifact Available " badge.

Our artifact has two components: the labeled dataset in our empirical study and our bug detection tool TVMFuzz. The dataset provides the basic support for our paper.  It contains the basic information of the 603 bugs studied by us and the extra information that was manually labeled by us. To reproduce the figures based on the dataset in our paper, a drawing script is provided. TVMFuzz is a tool designed by us to fuzz the TVM. To facilitate the reproduction process, we also provide a docker file. The detailed installation guide, usage method, and result analysis are all included in the INSTALL file. In addition, the artifact is open sourced with Apache-2.0 License.
Through the artifacts, other authors can easily replicate our paper. Therefore, we believe that the artifact deserves the "Artifact Evaluated "  badge.
